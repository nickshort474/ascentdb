							<h4>Linking to other websites</h4>
							<p>CombatDatabase.co.uk may contains links to other websites. This Website does not endorse or favour any specific commercial product or business. Websites are present only because they may be useful additions to the information we provide.

							A link to a third-party website does not imply endorsement - you must use your own judgement to decide whether the information or service on that website is suitable for your needs. If a website is not linked to ours, this does not mean or imply that it is unsatisfactory. Any linked websites may be reviewed in the light of customer usage and feedback.

							We are not responsible for the content of any linked website and cannot take responsibility for the consequences of your using the information or services on linked websites. We cannot guarantee that these links will work all of the time.

							Websites that we link to may have 'Terms and Conditions' that are different from ours. Do not assume that our 'Terms and Conditions' apply to other websites</p>

							<h4>Other third party content</h4>
							<p>There may at times be embedded external content from third-party websites such as YouTube. This content is not published on combatdatabase.co.uk.

						</div>
						<br />

						<div>
							<h4>YouTube</h4>
							<p>Whilst we make all reasonable efforts to display only appropriate YouTube videos through the embedded YouTube player, we are not responsible for any YouTube content accessed from our website. After a selected video clip plays, YouTube may suggest related videos, which can be played in the embedded video player. In virtually all cases, these will be directly related to the subject of the selected video. Occasionally, YouTube users may erroneously assign key words to a video. It is therefore possible that an unrelated video could be displayed. Again, we are not responsible for this content. If you are concerned about this possibility, you should avoid viewing YouTube videos from the embedded player on this website.</p>

We will not be liable for any damages or loss arising out of or resulting from any unauthorised access to, alteration to or modification of information contained on this website.</p>

							<p>We make every effort to check and test our website during production. You must take your own precautions to ensure that the process which you employ for accessing this website does not expose you to risk of viruses, malicious computer code or other forms of interference which may damage your computer system.
